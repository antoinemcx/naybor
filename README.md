# Configuration

For the configuration, rename the `config-example.js` file to `config.js` and replace the :
```js
module.exports = {
    token: '',
    prefix: '',
    owner: "",
    db: {
        host: "",
        user: "",
        password: "",
        database: "",
    },
    serverID: "",
    logChannel: "",
    
    emotes: {},
};
```

# Commands

#### Installation
> `npm install`

#### Start the bot
> `npm run start`

# MariaDB

Naybor runs on the MariaDB database, a slightly modified version of MySQL.<br>
First, create the database. The name of the database must be the same as the one set in the `config.js` file
